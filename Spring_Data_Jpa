                                                                           Spring Data JPA
                                               it is a framework that simplifies database access in Spring Boot applications 
                                      it provide a abstarct layer over a java Persistence  api and enable the comuunication between application and database by using 
                                     object relational mapping  and inetnally use the hibernate for doing curd opertion's
         it provide  features like:- 
 1)reduce the boiler plate code for data access                          
2)Provides built-in CRUD methods

        
     ORM is a technique that maps Java objects to relational database tables, allowing developers to perform database operations using objects instead of SQL queries.
                  Without ORM (traditional way ❌)
                        String sql = "INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1, 'Parth')";
                    With ORM (JPA / Hibernate ✅)
                       Employee emp = new Employee(1, "Parth");
                       entityManager.persist(emp);
               

       
                           JPA stands for Java Persistence API. It is used to persist Java objects into the database and provides
                                      an ORM-based approach to handle database operations easily.


                                      ORM → Concept(Object ko Relational Database se map karna)
                                      JPA → Specification (rules)(Java ke liye ORM rules define karta hai)
                                      Hibernate → Implementation (tool)(JPA rules ko actually implement karta hai)
                                      Spring Data → Framework (Spring ke andar data access easy banane ke liye)
                                      pring Data JPA → Abstraction over JPA
                                     ->JPA ke upar ek extra layer
